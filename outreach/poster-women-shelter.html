                                    <p>If you and your children are staying in a shelter, basic income is so important and can help ease your stress. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) wants to make sure you get the benefit and credit payments you should be getting.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Meet Kim</strong></p>
                                    <p>Kim used to get benefit and credit payments for herself and her two children. Her payments were stopped because she forgot to do her taxes. The CRA needs her tax information to calculate her payments.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did she start getting her payments again?</strong> She did her taxes, which provided the CRA with her tax information. She also gave the CRA her new address at the shelter and her new direct deposit information, and she updated her marital status.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> Your personal information with the CRA is confidential and will never be shared without your consent.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Why did she never get her payments?</strong> Olivia never applied for the Canada child benefit (CCB).</p>
                                        
                                    <p><strong>What did she do to get her payments?</strong> She went online to canada.ca/child-family-benefits and followed the steps to apply for the CCB.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> When applying for the CCB, the CRA may ask you to send documents to support your application, but will never ask you to contact your abusive spouse.</p>

                                    <p><strong>What do you need to do?</strong></p>

                                    <p>If you were getting payments from the CRA but they stopped, call the CRA at <span class="no-wrap">1-800-387-1193</span> to discuss your situation. Your personal information may be out of date.</p>

                                    <p>If you never received payments from the CRA, you need to apply. Go online to canada.ca/child-family-benefits to get more information on benefits and credits. You can use the benefits calculator at canada.ca/child-family-benefits-calculator to find out how much your federal and provincial or territorial payments might be.</p>
