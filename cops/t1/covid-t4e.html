<p>If you received or repaid Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) from Service Canada, you should get a T4E tax slip. These   amounts will need to be reported on your 2022 tax return.</p>
<p>You will receive a T4E slip at tax time or you may also get your T4E information from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>.</p>
<h3>Other tax slips you may receive</h3>

<h2 id="toc1">Verify amounts or issues on your T4E slip</h2>
<p>When you receive your T4E slip, make sure the CERB amounts you received are correct. To verify these amounts, you can view or print an itemized statement of your benefits paid through <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you received CERB from Service Canada and repaid amounts in 2022, verify that any CERB repayments you made before December 31, 2022 are accounted for. For more details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/tax-slips-itemized.html#h2-04">T4E and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have your T4E slip by March 10, 2023 or have an issue with your T4E slip, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/contact/ei-individual.html">contact Service Canada</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc3">Report T4E amounts on your tax return</h2>
<p>CERB benefit payment amounts received from Service Canada are included in <strong>box 14 </strong>of your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4e-statement-employment-insurance-other-benefits.html">T4E slip</a>.</p>
<p>The total amount in box 14 includes your CERB amounts along with other Employment Insurance benefits.</p>


<h3>Steps for reporting T4E amounts on your tax return</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find your total benefits paid amount in <strong>box 14 </strong>of your T4E slip </li>
  <li>If you are not eligible to receive tax exempt benefits under the Indian Act, take the amount in box 14 and <strong>subtract </strong>any amount from <strong>box 18 </strong>(under "Other information" on your T4E slip) </li>
  <li>Enter the amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-11900-employment-insurance-other-benefits.html">line 11900</a> on your return </li>
</ol>

<h3>CERB repayments on your T4E</h3>
<p>If you repay CERB amounts <strong>before January 1, 2023</strong>, you may choose when and how to claim the deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p>You have the option to claim your repayments as a deduction in the same year you made the repayment or in the year you received the benefits. You may also split the deduction between your tax returns, as long as you do not deduct more than what you repaid.</p>

<h3>If your income is tax exempt</h3>
<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, your CERB payments may be tax exempt. Your CERB payments are taxed in the same way your income was taxed during the timeframe that entitled you to the benefit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If all your income was tax exempt during the time you earned the $5,000 income requirement (in 2019 or in the last 12 months before you applied for the CERB), then the benefit is also tax exempt </li>
  <li>If your income during that time was not fully tax exempt, your benefit payment during the same time may not be fully  tax exempt </li>
</ul>
