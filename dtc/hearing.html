                                <h4>Transcript</h4>
                                <p>For some people, it may be that hearing poses a significant challenge. For instance, the ability to hear so as to understand a familiar person, in a quiet setting, even with appropriate therapy, medication, and devices.</p>
                                <p>In this first example, we have a person consulting with a doctor because the person is having trouble hearing with one ear.</p>
                                <p>Doctor: "Hello. What can I do for you today?"</p>
                                <p>Patient: "My ear hurts and I can't hear very well on this side."</p>
                                <p>Doctor: "How long have you been having this problem?"</p>
                                <p>Patient: "On and off for about a month."</p>
                                <p>Doctor leans forward to examine the patient, puts an otoscope into the ear of the patient, and says: "Let me take a look in that ear. Yes, you have a wax blockage that will have to be cleared."</p>
                                <p>In the first example, while the individual is having some difficulty hearing, it is attributable to a <span class="nowrap">short-term</span> condition. The person would, therefore, not qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>
                                <p>In the second example, a person is having a follow-up appointment with the doctor after having recently had a hearing implant inserted.</p>
                                <p>Doctor: "Has your cochlear implant improved your condition?"</p>
                                <p>While pointing to the left ear, the patient replies: "Yes, I can hear more clearly with the implant."</p>
                                <p>The second example shows an individual with a severe and prolonged hearing impairment, but who is able to hear adequately with the use of a hearing device. The person would, therefore, not qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>
                                <p>In this third example, a person is consulting with the doctor to find out the results of a hearing test.</p>
                                <p>Doctor: "Your audiogram shows profound bilateral hearing loss."</p>
                                <p>Patient shakes head and replies: "What did you say? I can't hear you."</p>
                                <p>Doctor leans forward, to get closer to the patient, and in a loud voice says: "I have your results and they certainly indicate a problem."</p>
                                <p>Patient looks confused and says: "I still can't hear you even with this hearing aid."</p>
                                <p>Doctor: "I am going to write this down for you to read" and hands the patient the piece of paper.</p>
                                <p>The patient reads the paper and nods head to doctor, acknowledging what has been written.</p>
                                <p>In this third example, the individual is markedly restricted in hearing even with the use of a hearing device, and would therefore qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>

<p>For some people, it may be that hearing poses a significant challenge. For instance, the ability to hear so as to understand a familiar person, in a quiet setting, even with appropriate therapy, medication, and devices.</p>
<p>In this first example, we have a person consulting with a doctor because the person is having trouble hearing with one ear.</p>
<p>Doctor: "Hello. What can I do for you today?"</p>
<p>Patient: "My ear hurts and I can't hear very well on this side."</p>
<p>Doctor: "How long have you been having this problem?"</p>
<p>Patient: "On and off for about a month."</p>
<p>Doctor leans forward to examine the patient, puts an otoscope into the ear of the patient, and says: "Let me take a look in that ear. Yes, you have a wax blockage that will have to be cleared."</p>
<p>In the first example, while the individual is having some difficulty hearing, it is attributable to a <span class="nowrap">short-term</span> condition. The person would, therefore, not qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>
<p>In the second example, a person is having a follow-up appointment with the doctor after having recently had a hearing implant inserted.</p>
<p>Doctor: "Has your cochlear implant improved your condition?"</p>
<p>While pointing to the left ear, the patient replies: "Yes, I can hear more clearly with the implant."</p>
<p>The second example shows an individual with a severe and prolonged hearing impairment, but who is able to hear adequately with the use of a hearing device. The person would, therefore, not qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>
<p>In this third example, a person is consulting with the doctor to find out the results of a hearing test.</p>
<p>Doctor: "Your audiogram shows profound bilateral hearing loss."</p>
<p>Patient shakes head and replies: "What did you say? I can't hear you."</p>
<p>Doctor leans forward, to get closer to the patient, and in a loud voice says: "I have your results and they certainly indicate a problem."</p>
<p>Patient looks confused and says: "I still can't hear you even with this hearing aid."</p>
<p>Doctor: "I am going to write this down for you to read" and hands the patient the piece of paper.</p>
<p>The patient reads the paper and nods head to doctor, acknowledging what has been written.</p>
<p>In this third example, the individual is markedly restricted in hearing even with the use of a hearing device, and would therefore qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>

                            <p>When he was a child, Kevin lost his hearing due to a head injury. Although Kevin has hearing aids, he continues to have difficulty hearing.</p>
                            <p>Kevin applied for the DTC. As a result of the information provided by the medical practitioner on the application form, he is now eligible for the tax credit because he is deaf.</p>
