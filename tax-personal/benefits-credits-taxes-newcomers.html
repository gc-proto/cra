      <div class="col-md-8">
	      <p>A SIN is a 9-digit number that is personal, confidential, and unique to you.</p>
	      <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>receive benefits and credits</li>
		      <li>work in Canada</li>
		      <li>open most types of bank accounts</li>

	      <p>Go to <strong>Service Canada</strong> to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">apply for a SIN</a>.</p>

		      <h3>What to do if you can't get a SIN</h3>
	      	      <p>If Service Canada is unable to give you a permanent or temporary SIN, CRA may give you a temporary tax number (TTN) you may use to get benefits and credits, file taxes, and sign up for CRA's online services.</p>
	      <details>
		      <summary>How to get a TTN</summary>
		      <p>Complete your benefit or credit application [or tax return - to be verified] without an account number. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>
		      <p>To get a number faster, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a passport</li>
<li>a driver's licence</li>
<li>a birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
<li>an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you (if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you)</li>
<li>a letter from Citizenship and Immigration Canada stating they are reviewing your file</li>
		      </ul>
		      </details>
		<!--<p>If you get a temporary SIN from Service Canada (starting with 9), a TTN, or an individual tax number (ITN) from CRA, and you decide to become a permanent resident of Canada, you must apply for a new SIN with Service Canada. Once you have a SIN, do not use any other SIN, TTN, or ITN you were previously given.</p>
