    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
	      <p>A SIN is a 9-digit number that is personal, confidential, and unique to you.</p>
	      <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>receive benefits and credits</li>
		      <li>work in Canada</li>
		      <li>open most types of bank accounts</li>

	      <p>Go to <strong>Service Canada</strong> to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">apply for a SIN</a>.</p>

		      <h3>What to do if you can't get a SIN</h3>
	      	      <p>If Service Canada is unable to give you a permanent or temporary SIN, the CRA may give you a temporary tax number (TTN) you may use to get benefits and credits, file taxes, and sign up for CRA's online services.</p>
	      <details>
		      <summary>How to get a TTN</summary>
		      <p>Complete your benefit or credit application or tax return without an account number. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>
		      <p>To get a number faster, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a passport</li>
<li>a driver's licence</li>
<li>a birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
<li>an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you (if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you)</li>
<li>a letter from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a> that says they are reviewing your file</li>
		      </ul>
		      </details>
		<!--<p>If you get a temporary SIN from Service Canada (starting with 9), a TTN, or an individual tax number (ITN) from CRA, and you decide to become a permanent resident of Canada, you must apply for a new SIN with Service Canada. Once you have a SIN, do not use any other SIN, TTN, or ITN you were previously given.</p>

        <p>[Many of the benefits people enjoy in Canada are made possible through taxes. Canada's tax system pays for roads, schools, health care, social security, and public safety.]</p>
		<p>[Canada’s tax system is similar to that of many countries. If you are an employee, your employer usually deducts taxes and pays them to the CRA on your behalf. If you have business or rental income, you may pay taxes to the CRA directly throughout the year.]</p>

<p>[Each year, most people determine if they have a tax amount owing or to be refunded to them by completing a tax return (called an Income Tax and Benefit Return) and sending it to the CRA.]</p>
