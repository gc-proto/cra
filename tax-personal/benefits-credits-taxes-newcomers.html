	      <p>A SIN is a 9 digit identification number that is unique to you. You are the only person who is supposed to use it, and you are responsible for keeping it safe. If your SIN gets into the wrong hands, it could lead to fraud or even identity theft.]</p>

	      <p>[The CRA uses your SIN to identify you for income tax and benefit purposes. You have to give your SIN to anyone who prepares tax information slips (such as a T4 slip) for you.]</p>
	      <p>[If Service Canada gave you a temporary SIN (starting with the number 9) or if the CRA gave you a temporary tax number (TTN) or an individual tax number (ITN), and you decide to become a permanent resident of Canada, you have to apply for a SIN with Service Canada.

        <p>If you owned certain properties, other than taxable Canadian properties, at the time you immigrated to Canada, the CRA considers you to have sold the properties and to have immediately reacquired them at a cost equal to their fair market value (FMV) on the date you became a resident of Canada.

    <p>Your property could include the following: shares, jewelry, paintings or a collection.</p>
    <p>Usually, the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> is the highest dollar value you can get for your property in a normal business transaction.</p>
    <p>You should keep a record of the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> of your properties on the date you arrived in Canada. The <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> will be your cost when you calculate your gain or loss from&nbsp;disposing the property in the future.</p>

    <summary>Treaty-exempt income</summary>
    <p>You have to report your world income that you received after you became a resident of Canada. World income is income from all sources both inside and outside Canada. However, part or all of the income may be exempt from Canadian tax. This may be the case if Canada has a <a href="https://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/treatystatus_-eng.asp">tax treaty</a> with the country in which you earned the income and there is a provision in the treaty that prevents Canada from taxing the type of income you received. You can deduct the exempt part on <span class="nowrap"><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-256-additional-deductions/line-256-exempt-foreign-income.html">line 256</a></span> of your tax return.</p>
    <p>If you are not sure if the applicable tax treaty contains a provision that makes your income from sources outside of Canada exempt from tax in Canada, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/international-ottawa-tax-services-office.html#ntrntnl">contact the CRA</a>.</p>

    <p>The&nbsp;federal non-refundable tax credits you can claim are&nbsp;limited to the total of the following amounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the federal non‑refundable tax credits that apply to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/individuals-leaving-entering-canada-non-residents/federal-non-refundable-tax-credits-newcomers-emigrants.html#rc">part of&nbsp;the year that you were a resident of&nbsp;Canada</a></li>

    <summary>Provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits (Form 428)</summary>
    <p>Similar to the amount of federal non-refundable tax credits, as an immigrant, you may be limited in the amount you can claim this year for certain provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits.</p>
    <p>Generally, the rules for calculating your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/provincial-territorial-tax-credits-individuals.html">provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits</a> are the same rules as those used to calculate your&nbsp;corresponding federal non‑refundable tax credits. However, the amounts used in calculating&nbsp;most provincial or territorial non‑refundable tax credits are different from the corresponding federal credits.</p>

    <summary>Federal tax credits</summary>
    <p><strong>For the part of the year that you were a resident of Canada</strong>, if you were an eligible educator, you can claim the eligible educator school supply tax credit for eligible supplies expenses paid in 2018 that relate to the period of residency.</p>
    <p><strong>For the part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada</strong>, you can claim the above tax credit for eligible supplies expenses paid in 2018 that relate to the period of non-residency if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="nowrap">Canadian-source</span> income you are reporting for the part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada represents <strong>90% or more</strong> of your net world income for that part of the year</li>
      <li>you had no income from sources inside and outside Canada for that part of the year</li>

    <summary>Federal foreign tax credits (Form T2209)</summary>
    <p>After you become a resident of Canada, you may receive income from the country where you used to live or from another country. This income may be subject to tax in Canada <strong>and</strong> the other country. This could happen if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>no tax treaty exists between Canada and the other country</li>
      <li>there is no provision in the tax treaty that prevents both countries from taxing the type of income you received</li>

    <p>If this is your situation, you may be able to reduce the amount of federal tax you have to pay in Canada by claiming a federal foreign tax credit for the foreign tax you paid.
