    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
	      <p>A SIN is a 9-digit number that is personal, confidential, and unique to you.</p>
	      <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>receive benefits and credits</li>
		      <li>work in Canada</li>
		      <li>open a bank account</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Go to <strong>Service Canada</strong> to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">apply for a SIN</a>.</p>

		      <h3>What to do if you can't get a SIN</h3>
	      	      <p>If Service Canada is unable to give you a permanent or temporary SIN, CRA may give you a temporary tax number (TTN) you may use to get benefits and credits, file taxes, and sign up for CRA's online services.</p>
	      <p>If you are a non-resident, CRA may give you an individual tax number (ITN).</p>
	      <details>
		      <summary>How to get a TTN or ITN</summary>
		      <p>Complete your benefit or credit application [or tax return - to be verified] without an account number. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>
		      <p>To get a number faster, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>passport</li>
<li>driver's licence</li>
<li>birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
<li>if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you, an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you</li>
<li>a letter from Citizenship and Immigration Canada stating they are reviewing your file</li>
		      </ul>
	      <p>Whether you get a TTN or an ITN depends on your residency status when we review your request.</p>
		      </details>
		<!--<p>If you get a temporary SIN from Service Canada (starting with 9), a TTN, or an individual tax number (ITN) from CRA, and you decide to become a permanent resident of Canada, you must apply for a new SIN with Service Canada. Once you have a SIN, do not use any other SIN, TTN, or ITN you were previously given.</p> -->

        <p>If you owned certain properties, other than taxable Canadian properties, at the time you immigrated to Canada, the CRA considers you to have sold the properties and to have immediately reacquired them at a cost equal to their fair market value (FMV) on the date you became a resident of Canada. This is a deemed disposition.</p>
    <p>Your property could include the following: shares, jewelry, paintings or a collection.</p>
    <p>Usually, the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> is the highest dollar value you can get for your property in a normal business transaction.</p>
    <p>You should keep a record of the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> of your properties on the date you arrived in Canada. The <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> will be your cost when you calculate your gain or loss from&nbsp;disposing the property in the future.</p>
    <p>You dispose of your property when:</p>
    <ul class="list-inline">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> you&nbsp;sell it</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> you give it&nbsp;</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> it's destroyed</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> it's stolen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have a loss resulting from the disposition of those properties, you can only deduct those losses from any gains you had from selling the same type of property. You <strong>cannot</strong> use this type of loss to reduce any capital gains you had from selling other types of properties.</p>

    <summary>Treaty-exempt income</summary>
    <p>You have to report your world income that you received after you became a resident of Canada. World income is income from all sources both inside and outside Canada. However, part or all of the income may be exempt from Canadian tax. This may be the case if Canada has a <a href="https://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/treatystatus_-eng.asp">tax treaty</a> with the country in which you earned the income and there is a provision in the treaty that prevents Canada from taxing the type of income you received.

    <p>Similar to the amount of federal non-refundable tax credits, as an immigrant, you may be limited in the amount you can claim this year for certain provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits.</p>
    <p>Generally, the rules for calculating your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/provincial-territorial-tax-credits-individuals.html">provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits</a> are the same rules as those used to calculate your&nbsp;corresponding federal non‑refundable tax credits.

    <summary>Federal tax credits</summary>
    <p><strong>For the part of the year that you were a resident of Canada</strong>, if you were an eligible educator, you can claim the eligible educator school supply tax credit for eligible supplies expenses paid in 2018 that relate to the period of residency.</p>

    <p>After you become a resident of Canada, you may receive income from the country where you used to live or from another country. This income may be subject to tax in Canada <strong>and</strong> the other country. This could happen if:</p>

      <li>there is no provision in the tax treaty that prevents both countries from taxing the type of income you received</li>
