		<h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-sm">What is an election?</h2>
		<p>In some instances, the Income Tax Act allows taxpayers to choose when and how they want to be taxed. These provisions are called “elections”.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, a taxpayer can choose between:
<ul><li>using a default set of tax rules</li> 
	<li>electing (choosing) an alternative set of rules</li></p></ul>
<p>This "election" gives taxpayers options and flexibility in handling their financial matters.</p>
<p> This page provides information on the elections available, how to amend or revoke them, and the consequences of filing late.</p>

            <h2 id="h-1">Amending, revoking, or filing a late election</h2>
      	<p>A request to have a late or amended election accepted, or to revoke an election, is limited to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. </p>
     <p>Most election provisions do not:
	   <ul><li>permit you to file an election once the due date for making the election is missed </li>
		   <li>give you the ability to modify or cancel an original election that was filed on time</li></ul>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may, however, allow you to modify or cancel elections that have already been filed, or file an election even if you missed the deadline.</p>
		<ul><li><strong>Amending your election</strong>: amending your election is best done before the date the election is due. You may apply to have your election amended after the due date, but the CRA may not accept your request.</li>
			<li><strong>Revoking your election</strong>: revoking your election is best done before the date the election is due. You may apply to have your election revoked after the due date, but the CRA may not accept your request.</li></ul>
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: you may be liable to a penalty if you file your election late, or apply to amend or revoke your election after the due date. For more information, see <a href="#h-8"><span>Penalty for accepting a late, amended, or revoked election</span></a>.</p>

		<h2 id="h-2">List of prescribed elections</h2>
		<p> For the complete list and details of the eligible elections, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic07-1/taxpayer-relief-provisions-1r1.html#aa"><span>List of prescribed elections</span><a/>.</p>
	<h2 id="h-3">List of designations and allocations that are considered prescribed elections</h2>
		<p> For the list of designations and allocations that are considered prescribed elections, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic07-1/taxpayer-relief-provisions-1r1.html#s55"><span>Deemed Prescribed Elections</span></a>.</p>            
        
		<h2 id="h-4">Circumstances where the CRA may accept your request</h2>
	<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <strong>may</strong> accept your request in the following situations:</p><ul>
	<ul class="fa-ul">
	                <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the late, amended, or revoked election must be correct in law based on the relevant legislation in place for the applicable tax year to which the election applies</li>
	                <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>have been tax consequences that you did not intend and there is evidence you took reasonable steps to comply with the law</li>
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>a late request due to circumstances beyond your control, for example:</li></ul>
				<ul><ul>
					<li>or man-made disasters (such as:  flood or fire)</li>
					<li>civil disturbances or disruptions in services, (such as a postal strike)</li>
					<li>a serious illness or accident</li>
					<li>serious emotional or mental distress, (such as death in the immediate family)</li></ul>
		</ul></li>
		<ul class="fa-ul">
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>it is evident you acted on incorrect information given by the CRA, such as an incorrect written reply to your question or an error in a CRA publication</li>
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the request results from what is a mechanical error, for example, using the net book value amount when it was clear you intended to use the undepreciated capital cost</li>
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the later accounting of the transactions by all parties is as if the election had been made</li>
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>you can show that you were not aware of the election provisions, even though you took a reasonable amount of care to comply with the law, and took action to correct the situation as quickly as possible</li>
		</ul>
	          
   
		<h2 id="h5">Instances when your request will be denied</h2>
		<p>The CRA will not accept a request in the following instances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>it is reasonable to conclude you made the request for retroactive tax planning purposes, for example, taking advantage of changes to the law enacted after the due date of the election</li>
			<li>adequate records do not exist</li>
	                <li>it is reasonable to conclude you had to make the request because you were negligent or careless in complying with the law</li></ul>
<p>
                <p>In addition to the above, there are certain requests that cannot be considered for relief under the Taxpayer Relief Provisions.

		</ul>
		<p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong>
<p>Indicate with your request if this is the first or <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/contact/taxpayer-relief/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/after-apply.html#h-6">second review</a>. A second review request is when you ask the CRA to reconsider its original decision.</p>

            <h2 id="h-8">Penalty for accepting a late, amended, or revoked election</h2>
            <p>If the CRA accepts your late, amended, or revoked election request, you are liable to a penalty.</p>  
            <p>The penalty is the lesser of the following amounts:</p>  
            <ol class="alpha dblSpList"> 
                <li>$8,000</li> 
                <li>$100 for each complete month from the election's original due date to the date your request was made in a form satisfactory to the CRA</li> 
            </ol>  
<h3>Payment of the penalty amount</h3>
		<p>Penalty payments can be sent to the CRA with your request.</p>
<p>It is CRA policy not to accept late, amended, or revoked elections, or to process or adjust the income tax return, unless the penalty amount noted above is paid.</p>
<p>After the CRA receives your payment, if there is an amount outstanding, the CRA will determine and assess the unpaid balance, which you must pay immediately.</p>
             
            <h4>Relief from the penalty</h4>
            <p>In certain circumstances, the CRA may cancel or waive the penalty amount. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest.html">Cancel or waive penalties or interest</a>.</p>
	<p>A request to waive the penalty amount may be submitted with the request to file a late, amended, or revoked election. You do not have to file a separate penalty relief request.</p> 
       
        <section>
            <h2 id="h-9">After the CRA receives your request</h2>
          <p>Once the CRA has started reviewing your request, we may contact you if we need help understanding what you provided, or to get any missing information.</p>
            <p>In all cases, once the review of your request is complete, we will notify you of our decision, including the reason for the decision if it is only partially approved or denied.</p>

		
            <h3>Approval or denial of your request</h3>
          <p>When accepted by the CRA, a late or amended election will be considered to have been made at the time it was required to be made. For amended or revoked elections, the original election will be cancelled. To give effect to the acceptance of a late, amended, or revoked election, the CRA will reassess the affected returns for the tax years in question even if the years are beyond the normal reassessment period.</p>
<p>Any assessments or reassessments resulting from the CRA's acceptance of the request is subject to the general provisions concerning arrears interest charged on the balance owing.</p>
<p>If your late, amended, or revoked election is accepted, you can file an objection to dispute the resulting assessment or reassessment. However, the objection is limited to issues related to that election. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/file-objection-cppei-appeal-minister.html">File an objection</a>.</p>
