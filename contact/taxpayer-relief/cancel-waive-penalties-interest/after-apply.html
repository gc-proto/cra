                <h2 id="h-1">We may ask you for more information</h2>
                <p>Once the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has started reviewing your request, we may contact you if we need help understanding what you provided, or to get any missing information.</p>
		<p>If we request additional supporting documents, you can submit them through the "Submit documents online" service in My Account or My Business Account.

               <h2 id="h-2">Factors we use to make our decision</h2>
                <p>When circumstances beyond your control, actions by the CRA, an inability to pay or financial hardship prevent you from meeting your tax obligations, the CRA will look at the following when determining whether or not to cancel or waive penalties and interest:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>your tax return filing and payment history</li>
                  <li>if you knowingly let a balance owing exist which resulted in additional interest</li>
                  <li>if you took reasonable care in managing your tax affairs</li>
                  <li>if you acted quickly to address any delay or omission</li>
                </ul>

                            <section>
                <h2 id="h-3">When you can expect a decision</h2>
                <p>The CRA aims to issue a taxpayer relief decision within 180 calendar days of receiving the request. However, due to a higher than normal number of requests for relief, it could take longer to process your request.</p>
<p> Taxpayers or their representatives can stay up to date with the status of their requests for relief of penalties and interest by using the Progress Tracker tool. To view the status of your request, go to Progress Tracker on the Overview page in your CRA My Account or Represent a client Account.</p>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-5">If your request for relief is approved</h2>
                <p>If the CRA approves your request for relief, the following may happen:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>your amount owing may be reduced</li>
                  <li>a refund may be issued</li>
		      </ul>
		      <p> However, depending on whether you paid, or partially paid any penalty or interest amounts, or whether you have debts from other tax years or other related tax accounts, the following could happen:</p>
                 <ul> <li>your refund could be applied to other debts</li>
                  <li>your refund could be held until you file any past due returns</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Find out more about the rules around credits and refunds in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic07-1/taxpayer-relief-provisions-1r1.html#s90">paragraphs 90 to 99 of Information Circular IC07-1R1</a></p>

                <h2 id="h-6">Options if your request is denied or partially approved</h3>
                <p>If you believe our decision was not fair and reasonable, there are recourse options available to you.</p>
				<h3>Second administrative review</h3>
                <p>You may ask for a second review online, go to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/contact/taxpayer-relief/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/how-apply-d.html#h-2"> Submit your request</a> for more information. Alternatively, you can send a letter to one of the following:
				<ul><li>the address provided in the decision letter you received
				<li>the <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/contact/taxpayer-relief/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/how-apply-d.html#h-3">Intake Centre</a> responsible for your province or territory of residence</p></li>
				</ul>
                <p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing or misinterpreted or not considered in their proper context</li>
                  <li>any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Judicial review</h3>
                <p>If you still feel that we were not fair and reasonable, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html"> apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review</a> of our decision. You must do this within 30 calendar days of the date you received the decision from the second administrative review. To maintain fairness and transparency, the CRA official who completed the first review will not conduct the second review. <p>
                 <h3>Requestion for remission review</h3>
                <p>If we deny your request to cancel or waive interest or penalties, you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/when-request-remission-review.html">may be able to make a remission request<a>.</p>
