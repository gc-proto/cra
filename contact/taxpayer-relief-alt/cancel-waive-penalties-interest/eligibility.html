                <p>The Minister may grant relief from penalty or interest when the following types of situations prevent a taxpayer from meeting their tax obligations:</p>
      
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li>

                      <summary>Extraordinary circumstances beyond your control</summary>
                      <p>Penalties or interest may be cancelled or waived in whole or in part when they result from circumstances beyond a taxpayer's control. Extraordinary circumstances that may have prevented a taxpayer from making a payment when due, filing a return on time, or otherwise complying with a tax obligation include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>natural or human-made disasters, such as a flood or fire</li>
                        <li>civil disturbances or disruptions in services, such as a postal strike</li>
                        <li>serious illness or accident</li>
                        <li>serious emotional or mental distress, such as death in the immediate family</li>
                      </ul>

                      <summary>Mistakes made by the CRA</summary>
                      <p>The CRA may also cancel or waive penalties or interest when they result primarily from CRA actions, including:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>processing delays that result in taxpayers not being informed, within a reasonable time, that an amount was owing</li>
                        <li>errors in CRA material which led a taxpayer to file a return or make a payment based on incorrect information</li>
                        <li>incorrect information provided to a taxpayer by the CRA</li>
                        <li>errors in processing</li>
                        <li>delays in providing information, resulting in taxpayers not being able to meet their tax obligations in a timely manner</li>
                        <li>undue delays in resolving an objection or an appeal, or in completing an audit</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                  </li>

                    <details>
                      <summary>Inability to pay or financial hardship</summary>
                      <p>The CRA may, in circumstances where there is a confirmed inability to pay amounts owing, consider waiving or cancelling interest in whole or in part to enable taxpayers to pay their account. For example, this could occur when:</p>  
                      <ul> 
                        <li>a collection has been suspended because of an inability to pay caused by the loss of employment and the taxpayer is experiencing financial hardship</li> 
                        <li>a taxpayer is unable to conclude a payment arrangement because the interest charges represent a significant portion of the payments, or</li> 
                        <li>payment of the accumulated interest would cause a prolonged inability to provide basic necessities (financial hardship) such as food, medical help, transportation, or shelter; consideration may be given to cancelling all or part of the total accumulated interest</li> 
                      </ul>  
                      <p>Consideration would not generally be given to cancelling a penalty based on an inability to pay or financial hardship unless an extraordinary circumstance prevented compliance, or an exceptional situation existed. For example, when a business is experiencing extreme financial difficulty and enforcement of such penalties would jeopardize the continuity of its operations, the jobs of the employees, and the welfare of the community as a whole, consideration may be given to providing relief of the penalties.</p>
                      <p>For requests to cancel or waive interest or penalties based on an inability to pay or financial hardship, the CRA requires full financial disclosure from taxpayers, including a statement of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. To help individual taxpayers provide full financial disclosure, please see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/statement-income-expenses-assets-liabilities-individuals.html"> <span>Statement of Income and Expenses and Assets and Liabilities for Individuals</span> </a>.

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if your circumstances do not fall within one of the situations described above, the CRA may grant relief in similar situations.</p>
      
                <h3>Relief is limited to the past 10 years</h3>
                <p>The Minister's discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 years before the calendar year in which a request is submitted or an income tax return is filed.</p>
                <p>The 10-year limitation period rolls forward every January 1.</p> 
      
                <details>
                  <summary>Penalty, election, and refund or adjustment requests under the Income Tax Act</summary>
                  <p>A taxpayer has 10 years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax year or fiscal period at issue ended to make a request to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for relief to:</p>  
                  <ul> 
                    <li>cancel or waive penalties;</li> 
                    <li>accept a late, amended, or revoked income tax election; or</li> 
                    <li>issue a refund or adjustment beyond the normal three-year period</li> 
                  </ul>  
                  <p>This means that for requests or income tax returns that are filed in the current calendar year, the Minister has no authority to provide relief when the request is for a tax year or fiscal period that ended more than 10 years before the calendar year in which the request is made.</p>

                    <p>To be eligible for consideration, an initial request or income tax return filed during the 2015 calendar year must deal with an issue related to the taxpayer's 2005 and later tax years (or fiscal periods). A request or return related to a taxpayer’s 2004 and previous tax years (or fiscal periods) is not eligible for consideration since those tax years (or fiscal periods) are beyond the 10-year period.</p>
