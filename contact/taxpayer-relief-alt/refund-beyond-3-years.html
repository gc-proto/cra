         <p>The Income Tax Act sets a three-year limitation period on issuing a refund or reducing an amount payable.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances, however, when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may consider issuing a refund or reducing an amount owing beyond the three-year deadline.</p>
		<p> This page provides information on who can apply, the circumstances that may qualify, and how to apply.</p>
		
		<h2>On this page:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#h-1">Who can apply</a></li>
			<li><a href="#h-2">Circumstances where the CRA may accept your request</a></li>
			<li><a href="#h-3">Instances where your request may be denied</a></li>
			<li><a href="#h-4">How to apply</a></li>
			<li><a href="#h-5">After the CRA receives your request</a><li>

	<h2 id="h-1">Who can apply</h2>
	<p>For  individuals (other than a trust) and graduated rate estates, there is a three-year limitation period from the:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>end of the tax year to file an income tax return to claim a tax refund</li>
		<li>date of the original notice of assessment to request an adjustment to an assessment issued for a previous tax year</li>
	</ul>
			<p>
<p>As of January 1, 2016, a testamentary trust (that is not a graduated rate estate) can no longer do the following for the 2016 and later tax years, after the normal three-year period has expired:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>file an income tax return with the intent of getting a refund</li>
		<li>request an adjustment to a previously filed return with the intent of reducing the tax payable</li></ul>
<p>
			<p>Testamentary trusts can still file a return or ask for an adjustment for the 2015 and previous tax years.</p>


          <h2 id="h-2">Circumstances where the CRA may accept your request</h2>
		<p>The CRA <strong>may</strong> issue a refund or reduce the amount owed if we are satisfied that such a refund or reduction would have been made if:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>the return or request had been filed or made on time</li>
			<li>the necessary assessment is correct in law and has not been already allowed</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can make a request for a refund or adjustment if you were not aware of, or missed, claiming a deduction or credit that is available for the year, including any overpayment of taxes deducted from your salary.</p>
<p>In addition to deductions or credits, eligible individuals can also ask the CRA to redetermine the following amounts that are considered either as a payment on account of tax, or overpayment of tax:</p>
		<ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Canada Child Benefit (CCB) payments</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credits</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>refundable medical expenses supplement</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>working income tax benefit (WITB)</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>working income tax benefit (WITB) disability supplement</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>refundable Quebec abatement for income earned in Quebec by a Quebec resident</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>refundable investment tax credit</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>refundable First Nations abatement for individuals who are subject to income tax legislation of certain First Nations</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the tax credit that a beneficiary of a mining reclamation trust can claim</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the tax credit that certain beneficiaries can claim for the Part XII.2 tax paid by a trust</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the tax credit a Canadian partnership flows through to its partners for the Part XII.2 tax paid by a trust</li>

		<h2 id="h-3">Instances when your request may be denied</h2>
		<p>Depending on the circumstances, the CRA may accept your request. See the situations below to find out more information on what we will or will not consider:</p>
		<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Dispute an assessment or reassessment</summary>
			<p> The purpose for requesting an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period can not be to dispute how correct or valid a previous assessment is.</p>
                    <p>The CRA will not allow an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period when the individual or graduated rate estate chose not to dispute the issues through the normal objection or appeal process. For example, an audit reassessment, or where the issues were already dealt with under the objection process. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/file-objection-cppei-appeal-minister.html">File an objection</a>.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Requests affecting the statute-barred income tax return of another individual</summary>
                    <p>The CRA will generally not accept a request for an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period to the income tax return of another individual. For example, if the adjustment would result in the increase of one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>taxes</li>
					<li>interest</li></ul>
			<p>
		<p>The CRA cannot reassess penalties on the income tax return of another individual when the time limit for objecting to, or requesting relief from, has already passed (statute-barred).</p>
                </details>
		</li>
			<li>
			<details>
				<summary>Provincial benefits or credits</summary>
				<p>The legislation that allows the CRA the discretion to refund or reduce the amount payable beyond the normal three-year period does not override provincial limitations, unless it is indicated in the provincial act. For example, if there are time limits to claim certain provincial benefits or credits (that the CRA administers on behalf of the provinces).</p>
			</details>
				</li>
		<li>
		<details>		
			<summary>Permissive deductions</summary>
			<p>The CRA will not process requests for adjustments when the taxpayer originally claimed less than the maximum amount allowed. For example, if the requested decrease in tax is the result of an increased claim for capital cost allowance or other allowable deductions. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic84-1/revision-capital-cost-allowance-claims-other-permissive-deductions.html">Information Circular IC84-1, Revision of Capital Cost Allowance Claims and Other Permissive Deductions</a>.</p>

	<li>
		<details>		
			<summary>Employment Insurance premiums and Canada Pension Plan contributions</summary>
					<p>The legislation does not allow the minister to issue refunds beyond the normal three-year period for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Employment Insurance (EI) premiums</li>
				<li>Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions</li></ul>	
					<div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>
          <ul>
<li>The time limit for a refund of an overpayment for EI premiums is three years while CPP contributions is four years.</li>
<li>In the case of retroactive Canada Pension Plan Disability pension benefits, effective September 1, 2010, the time limit for a refund of CPP overpayments is 10 years.</li>
		  </div>
						</ul>
		</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Requests based on a court decision or other resolution</summary>
					<p>If the request is made as a result of a court decision, the CRA will generally not allow for the reassessment of a return beyond the normal three-year period. Requests made to reassess a return beyond the normal three-year period based only on the successful appeal by another taxpayer will not be granted. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic75-7.html"> Information Circular IC75-7R3, Reassessment of a Return of Income</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, knowledge of another taxpayer's negotiated settlement to resolve an objection, or another taxpayer's consent to judgment on an appeal, will generally not be allowed an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period if the taxpayer has chosen not to protect his or her right of objection or appeal.</p>

			<h2 id="h-5">After the CRA receives your request</h2>
		<p>Once the CRA has started reviewing your request, we may contact you if we need help understanding what you provided, or to get any missing information.</p>
<p>In all cases, once we have finished our review, we will notify you, in writing, of our decision. Your request may be approved, partially approved, or denied. If your request is partially approved or denied, our letter will advise you on what you can do if you do not agree with our decision.</p>
			<h3>If your request is approved</h3>
			<p>Depending on your particular situation, any of the following may happen if your request is approved:</p>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Refund</summary>
					<p>You may receive a refund of your overpayment of tax as a result of the reassessment ore redetermination.</p> 
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Reduce the amount of your refund</summary>
					<p>The CRA may reduce the amount of your refund if the adjustment results in an increase of taxes, interest, or penalties. Under these circumstances, the CRA will usually only issue a refund for the amount that exceeds the taxes, interest, and penalties and apply the remainder to the new debt.</p>
					<p>If your Canada Child Benefit (CCB), Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), or goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GSH/HST) results in you having overpayments, your refund may be reduced accordingly.</p> 
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Refund interest</summary>
					<p>You are entitled to a refund if your request results in a reassessment or redetermination that either:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>cancels all or part of any penalty or interest that you already paid</li>
						<li>reduces the amount of tax you owed</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					<p>Refund interest is compounded daily at the prescribed rates starting on the 31st day after your request was received in full. If your request was received by filing an income tax return, refund interest will start on the 31st day after the date the return was filed.</p>
					<p>There is no interest paid on a refund for GST/HST credits, CCTB, or CCB payments made to an individual.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Applying your refund to other debts</summary>
					<p>Your refund may be applied to any other amount you owe, or are about to owe.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Exception</strong></p>

						<li>Air Travellers Security Charge Act</li>
						<li>Excise Act, 2001</li>
						<li>Excise Tax Act</li>

			<h3 id="h-6">Second administrative review</h3>
		<p>If you believe that the CRA made an error in its review, you can ask for a second review. You may request a second review by writing to the address provided in the first decision letter you received in reply to your first request for relief. You can also send a letter to the <a href="#h-7">Intake Centre</a> responsible for your province or territory of residence.</p>
		<p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
		<ul>
<li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing, misinterpreted, or not considered in their proper context</li>
			<li>any relevant new documents, facts, or correspondence</li>
		</ul><p>
<p>In order for the CRA to remain impartial and transparent, the official who completed the first review will not conduct the second review.</p>
<p>The CRA may still uphold its previous decision following a second review of your request for relief.</p>
			<p>
<h3 id="h-12">Judicial review</h3>
<p>If, after the second review, you still feel that we were not fair and reasonable, you can apply to the Federal Court for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html">judicial review</a> of our decision.
