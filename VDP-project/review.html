<h3>Factors considered for determining the appropriate program of relief</h3>
<p>In all programs, the following factors are considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dollar amounts involved</li>
<li>the number of years of non-compliance</li>
<li>the sophistication of the taxpayer or registrant</li>
<li>how quickly the taxpayer or registrant acted to correct their non-compliance upon its discovery</li>
<li>if the disclosure is made after a CRA statement about its intended specific focus of compliance (for example, the launch of a compliance project or campaign) or following broad-based CRA correspondence (for example, a letter issued to taxpayers working in a particular sector about a compliance issue).</li>
</ul>             
                  
               
<!--<h3><span class="far fa-clock"></span> How long it will take</h3>
<p>Is this something we would want to tell them as I remember you said that is approximately 3 years. Should we at least let them know? Plus if there is somewhere where they can see what the processing times are, such as <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a></p>

               
<h3>If we need more information</h3>
<p>Is this something that happens? I see from the content that you have to send it fully complete or it would be denied. </p>-->
               
<h2 id="h-3">Our decision about your application</h2>
<p>Once we have your application, we will check to make sure it meets the necessary conditions of a valid application.</p>

<p>If after our initial review, we determine that your application is missing information and/or documentation, we may deny your application. At times, we may contact you to request the missing information/ documentation and negotiate a reply date.</p>

<p>If your application is denied as not complete, because the information was not submitted by the due date, the CRA will not consider a request for a second administrative review and we will deny any later application for the same matter.</p>
               
<h3>If your application is approved</h3>
<p>If your application is accepted, you will receive a letter with the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The track, General, Limited, or Wash Transactions, that your application was accepted under</li>
    <li>The taxation year(s) eligible for relief</li>
</ul>

               <h3>If your application is denied</h3>
<p>If your application is denied, you will receive a letter giving you the reason for the denial.</p>
               <strong>Denied due to not complete</strong>
<p>If your application was denied as not complete, due to information not being sent by a provided due date, the CRA will not consider a request for a second administrative review and will deny any later application for the same matter. </p>
               <p>For details: <a href="#">paragraphs 59-60 of Information Circular IC00-1R6</a> or <a href="#">paragraphs 66-68 of the GST/HST Memorandum 16-5</a></p>
               
<h2 id="h-4">Disagreeing with our decision</h2>
<p>If you disagree with the CRA's decision, you still have options.</p>

<h3>Asking for a second administrative review</h3>

<p>If you believe the Minister of National Revenue has not been fair or reasonable, you can request a second administrative review or apply to the Federal Court (of Canada) for a review of the Minister’s decision (Judicial Review). Generally, taxpayers should request a second administrative review from the CRA before applying for a Judicial Review with the Federal Court.</p>

<p>To request a second review, send your written request to the Assistant Director of the Shawinigan National Verification and Collections Centre.</p>

<h3>Asking for a judicial review</h3>
<p>To request a judicial review, the taxpayer must send a completed Form 301, Notice of Application, with the appropriate filing fee, to the registrar of the Federal Court. For more information, see paragraphs 61-64 of Information Circular IC00-1R6 or paragraphs 69-72 of GST/HST Memorandum 16-5.</p>
