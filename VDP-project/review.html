<h3>Factors considered for determining the appropriate type of relief</h3>
<p>The following factors may be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dollar amounts involved</li>
<li>the number of years of non-compliance</li>
<li>the sophistication of the taxpayer or registrant</li>
<li>how quickly the taxpayer or registrant acted to correct their non-compliance upon its discovery</li>
<li>if the disclosure is made after a CRA statement about its intended specific focus of compliance (for example, the launch of a compliance project or campaign) or following broad-based CRA correspondence (for example, a letter issued to taxpayers working in a particular sector about a compliance issue)</li>
</ul>             


		    
<!--<h3><span class="far fa-clock"></span> How long it will take</h3>
<p>The CRA does not have service standards for communicating VDP decisions. Processing times may vary a lot and depends on many things, such as the type of disclosure you are making and our inventory levels. It may also take longer if information is missing.</p>-->
               
<h2 id="h-3">Our decision</h2>
<!--<p>Once we have your application, we will check to make sure it meets the necessary conditions of a valid application.</p>

<p>If after our initial review, we determine that your application is missing information and/or documentation, we may deny your application. At times, we may contact you to request the missing information/ documentation and negotiate a reply date.</p>

<p>If your application is denied as not complete, because the information was not submitted by the due date, the CRA will not consider a request for a second administrative review and we will deny any later application for the same matter.</p>-->
               
<h3>If your application is accepted</h3>
<p>You will receive a letter with the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>which program or category your application was placed in (General, Limited, or Wash transactions)</li>
    <li>which taxation year(s) were eligible for relief</li>
</ul>

               <h3>If your application is denied</h3>
<p>You will receive a letter giving you the reason for the denial.</p>
               
		    <p>If your application was <strong>denied as not complete</strong>, due to information not being sent by a provided due date, the CRA will not consider a request for a second administrative review and will deny any later application for the same matter. </p>
               <p>For details: <a href="#">paragraphs 59-60 of Information Circular IC00-1R6</a> or <a href="#">paragraphs 66-68 of the GST/HST Memorandum 16-5</a></p>
               
<h2 id="h-4">Disagreeing with our decision</h2>
<p>If you disagree with the CRA's decision or believe the Minister of National Revenue has not been fair or reasonable, you still have options.</p>

		    <p>You can request a second administrative review or apply to the Federal Court (of Canada) for a review of the Minister’s decision (Judicial Review). Generally, taxpayers should request a second administrative review from the CRA before applying for a Judicial Review with the Federal Court.</p>

<h3>Asking for a second administrative review</h3>

<p>To request a second review, send your written request to the Assistant Director of the Shawinigan National Verification and Collections Centre.</p>

<h3>Asking for a judicial review</h3>
<p>To request a judicial review, the taxpayer must send a completed Form 301, Notice of Application, with the appropriate filing fee, to the registrar of the Federal Court. </p>
		    	    
		    <p>For details: <a href="#">paragraphs 61-64 of Information Circular IC00-1R6</a> or <a href="#">paragraphs 69-72 of the GST/HST Memorandum 16-5</a></p>
