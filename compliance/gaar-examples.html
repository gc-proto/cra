  <h2 id="h_1">Overview</h2>
  <p>The CRA considers applying the GAAR whenever a taxpayer makes a transaction mainly to avoid, defer, or reduce tax.  That transaction could result in an outcome that is inconsistent with the relevant tax rules or generates duplicated or inflated tax attributes.</p>
	      
	      <p>The following are some examples of tax avoidance schemes where, in the CRA’s view, the GAAR would apply. All organization names and transactions are examples and any resemblance to actual organizations or actual transaction details is purely coincidental.</p>
        
<!--<p>The following are some examples of tax avoidance schemes where, in the CRA’s view, the GAAR would apply. This is not an exhaustive list of circumstances in which the CRA will apply the GAAR. Furthermore, all organization names and transactions are stylized examples. Any resemblance to actual organizations or actual transaction details is purely coincidental.</p>-->
<p>Taxpayers, including in-house tax advisers and the audit committees of public companies, may want to consult these examples to determine whether any tax planning they are contemplating is similar. </p>

 


<h2 id="h_2">Surplus stripping</h2>
<h3>Targeted abuse</h3>
<p>A transaction that results in the withdrawal or potential withdrawal  of surplus (retained earnings) of a corporation in a tax free manner and/or a return of capital in excess of the amount that reflects the investment made with after-tax funds. </p>
<h3>Abusive arrangement</h3>
<p>Transactions undertaken to strip corporate surplus in a manner that defeats the object, spirit and purpose of sections 84, 84.1, 212.1 and subsection 89(1) of the Income Tax Act are subject to the application of the GAAR.</p>
<h3>Transactions  - Scenario 1</h3>

<ol>
<li>Individual holds high ACB Class B shares on which the capital gains exemption was previously crystallized</li>
<li>Subco transfers Property A to Holdco in consideration for Class B shares of Holdco </li>
<li>As a result, the PUC of the Class B shares is increased across all Class B shares </li>
</ol>

 </details>

<h3>Transactions &ndash; Scenario 2 </h3>

<ol>
<li>Canco redeems the preferred shares held by the Individual, triggering a deemed dividend of $849,999 and an equivalent capital loss which is added to the ACB of the common shares under subsection 40(3.6) </li>
<li>Individual transfers his common shares to Holdco in consideration of preferred shares with an ACB and redemption value equivalent to the $850, 000 and nominal value common shares </li>
<li>Holdco redeems the preferred shares without any tax consequences </li>
</ol>

<h3>Transactions &ndash; Scenario 3 </h3>

<ol>
<li>By a series of transactions, Canco and Subco, two Canadian corporations within the same corporate group that had been parent and subsidiary became "sister" corporations </li>
<li>Subsequently, Canco and Subco proceeded with a horizontal amalgamation </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_3">Avoidance of the "stop-loss" rules</h2>
<h3>Targeted abuse</h3>
<p>Subsections 93(2)/(2.01) and 112(3) express a statutory scheme that reveal the existence of a unified policy within the Act in relation to the limitation of capital losses that may result from the disposition of shares of a foreign affiliate or Canadian corporation, by considering non-taxable dividends previously received by the corporate shareholder/taxpayer. In that regard, where transactions entered into resulted in the circumvention of these provisions, the capital loss will be denied to the extent of the amount of tax-free dividends received by the corporate taxpayer. </p>
<h3>Abusive arrangement</h3>
<p>A transaction or arrangement that results in a capital loss on the disposition of shares of a foreign affiliate (FA) while having previously paid tax-free dividends on the affiliate share or on a share for which the affiliate share was substituted. </p>
<h3>Transactions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Surplus of FA is distributed to Canco by way of exempt dividends </li>
<li>FA continues into Canada </li>
<li>Parentco subscribes to preferred shares of Subco (f.k.a. FA) </li>
<li>Subco winds-up, triggering a capital loss on the disposition of the common shares </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_4">Creation of an artificial capital loss </h2>
<h3>Targeted abuse</h3>
<p>The targeted abuse is the offsetting of a capital gain with an artificial capital loss (a loss that does not reflect a true decline in value of a capital asset or where there was no change in the taxpayers' overall economic power, which results in a misuse and abuse of sections 38, 39, 40 and of the Income Tax Act when read as a whole. </p>

<h3>Abusive arrangement</h3>
<p>Transactions referred to as "value  shifts" are where losses are created through a series of transactions designed to shift value from an existing class of shares to a newly issued class of shares.  The initial shares are then sold to a non-affiliated person resulting in an artificial capital loss that is used to offset a pre-existing or future capital gain.</p>
<h3>Transactions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Individual subscribes for common shares of Canco </li>
<li>Canco declares a dividend on the common shares held by the Individual. The dividend is payable by the issuance of preferred shares with high redemption value and low paid-up capital (commonly known as High/Low shares) </li>
<li>Individual sells its common shares of Canco to a non-affiliated person for a nominal amount. The disposition results in a capital loss </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_5">Discretionary trusts and the application of the 21 year deemed disposition rule</h2>
<h3>Targeted abuse</h3>
<p>The purpose of subsection 104(4) of the ITA is to prevent the use of trusts to defer indefinitely the recognition for tax purposes of gains accruing on certain types of property, mainly capital property. Subsection 104(4) generally treats capital property of a trust (other than certain trusts for the benefit of a spouse or common-law partner) as having been disposed of and reacquired by the trust every 21 years at the property's fair market value. </p>
<p>Moreover, subsection 104(5.8) of the ITA is an anti-avoidance rule designed to prevent the avoidance of the 21-year rule through the use of trust-to-trust transfers that do not involve dispositions of property at fair market value. </p>
<p>As stated during the 2017 CTF Annual Conference, the CRA will consider the application of the GAAR where transactions result in the "avoidance of the 21 year rule by trusts".</p>
<h3>Abusive arrangement </h3>
<p>This planning involves a transaction(s) or arrangement designed to avoid, or resulting in the avoidance of the 21 year rule by trusts, whether these are situations involving the distribution of property from a family trust to a Canadian corporation with non-resident shareholders, or the distribution of property by a Canadian resident discretionary family trust to a Canadian corporation whose shares are owned by another Canadian resident discretionary family trust  (circumventing the application of subsection 104(5.8)). </p>
<h3>Transactions &ndash; Scenario 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Old Trust is approaching its 21st anniversary </li>
<li>Canco is wholly owned by a newly established discretionary trust resident in Canada ("New Trust") </li>
<li>Canco was a beneficiary of Old Trust pursuant to its trust indenture </li>
<li>Old trust distributes its property with an unrealized gain to a Canco on a tax-deferred basis </li>
</ul>

<h3>Transactions &ndash; Scenario 2</h3>

<li>Old Trust is approaching its 21st anniversary </li>
<li>Canco is wholly owned by the Non-resident beneficiaries of the Old Trust </li>
<li>Canco was a beneficiary of Old Trust pursuant to its trust indenture </li>
<li>The property held by Old Trust is distributed on a tax deferred basis to Canco </li>

<h2 id="h_6">GAAR, statute barred years and penalties </h2>
<p>Pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), a misrepresentation must be "attributable to neglect, carelessness or willful default" or it must involve the commission of fraud in order for the CRA to reassess a particular tax return beyond the normal reassessment period.  For a penalty to apply under ss. 163(2), a taxpayer must have knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or an omission in their return. </p>
<p>The scope for their application is not limited to particular provisions of the Act, but apply for the purpose of the Act as a whole, including section 245 of the Act.  Therefore, the CRA could consider the application of either of the provisions above to tax avoidance arrangements involving the application of the GAAR. </p>
<p>Whether ss. 163(2) penalty applies in a given case or whether there has been a misrepresentation or fraud in accordance with subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), is a question of fact that can be determined only after a review of all the facts and circumstances. For example, a penalty may be considered in a situation where the taxpayer has disregarded the jurisprudence confirming the application of the GAAR in circumstances similar to the transaction(s) undertaken by or with the taxpayer. </p>
