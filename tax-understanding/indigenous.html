<p>If some or all of your income for 2019 or 2020 was tax exempt, one way to demonstrate your income eligibility is to complete and submit form T90, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t90.html">Income Exempt From Tax Under the Indian Act</a>, with your tax return.

Please note that before you can make any corrections, you have to wait until you get your notice of assessment from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>What is considered employment or self-employment income?</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible for <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr>, you must have met all <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra/who-apply.html">eligibility criteria</a>, including having earned employment or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months before the date of your application.</p>
<p>Employment income and self-employment income include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gross employment income, such as employment income reported on your T4 information slip;</li>
<li>Commission income</li>
<li>Other employment income, such as tips you have declared as income, royalties paid to artists, honoraria (for example, small amounts paid to emergency service volunteers)</li>
<li>Non-eligible dividends earned instead of payment for work</li>
<li>Net self-employment income</li>
<li>Provincial or Federal maternity and parental benefits</li>

However, you can still provide documentation to support your eligibility, primarily by ensuring your 2019 and 2020 tax returns have been filed.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> uses information from both the 2019 and 2020 income tax returns to assess eligibility for the <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr> and verify that individuals have met the minimum income requirement of $5,000. In situation where these income tax returns do not support an applicant’s eligibility, the applicant may be prompted to provide additional documentation to support their claim. Filing your tax returns is the best way to ensure that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has the information needed to verify income eligibility.</p>
<p>Although the filing deadline has passed, individuals that have not yet filed their 2019 and 2020 income tax and benefit returns are encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Late-filed tax returns can still be used to confirm eligibility for the <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr> and the suite of Recovery Benefits.</p>

<p>No. The exempt <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefit">CRB</abbr> should not be included in your income pursuant to paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act.

The recovery benefits you received will be taxed or tax exempt in the same way as the total income earned during the timeframe that entitled you to the benefit (2019 or the 12 months before the date you applied).</p>
<p>If your total income for the timeframe that entitled you to the recovery benefits was:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>tax exempt in both</strong> 2019 and the 12 months before you applied, your recovery benefits are tax exempt</li>
<li><strong>taxable</strong> both in 2019 and in the 12 months before you applied, your recovery benefits are taxable</li>

<p>An individual’s “income” as defined in subsection 8(3) of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act (the CRBA) is determined under part I of the Income Tax Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act excludes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act when computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year under Part I of the Act.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefits Act">CRBA</abbr> does not have a specific provision to include the section 87 exempt income for the purpose of calculating the income for repayment in subsection 8(2) of the <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefits Act">CRBA</abbr>. Pursuant to subsection 8(3) of the <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefits Act">CRBA</abbr>, an individual’s income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act is not included in the calculation of income, and therefore, the individual is not subject to the <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefit">CRB</abbr> repayment specified in subsection 8(2) of the <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefits Act">CRBA</abbr>.</p>

On May 31, 2021, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> began to gradually expand these up-front verification measures for individuals who have applied to the Canada Recovery Benefits.</p>
<p>If you have been applying for any of the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID</abbr>-19 recovery benefits, filing your 2019 and 2020 tax and benefit returns is the simplest way to avoid a potential delay in the receipt of your recovery benefit payments.</p>
<p>Although the filing deadline has passed, individuals that have not yet filed their 2019 and 2020 income tax and benefit returns are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you have tax exempt employment or self-employment income, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may not have the necessary income information on file to confirm your eligibility for the recovery benefits.</p>
<p>If some or all of your income for 2019 or 2020 was tax exempt, one way to demonstrate your income eligibility is to complete and submit form T90, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t90.html">Income Exempt From Tax Under the Indian Act</a>, with your tax return. If you have already filed a 2019 or 2020 return but did not include form T90, you can send an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/change-your-return.html">adjustment request</a> through <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, or use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/refile-online-t1-adjustments-efile-service-providers.html">ReFile option</a> on your preferred certified tax software to make a change. Please note that before you can make any corrections to a tax return, you have to wait until you get your notice of assessment from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for that tax year.</p>
<p>See &quot;If you receive a letter or message from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&quot; on this page if you received a letter from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> informing you that we were unable to confirm that you met the minimum income eligibility criteria for any <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr> payments you received in the past.</p>

        <h3>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>Will the <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr> be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>No. The <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr> is not considered to be situated on a reserve as there are insufficient factors connecting this income to a reserve. It is available to all Canadians who qualify and are paid from general government funds. This benefit is not paid by First Nations or with money specifically set aside for First Nation individuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, similar to a social assistance payment or an old age security payment, the <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr> is available to all eligible individuals regardless of whether they are First Nation individuals or whether they earned income in 2019 or in the 12-month period prior to the date of their application.</p>
<p>The fact that the recipient is a First Nation individual residing on a reserve is not sufficient to result in the benefit being situated on a reserve, and therefore, it is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Does the <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr> have to be included on line 7 of Form T90?</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>No. Form T90, Income exempt from tax under the Indian Act, is mainly used to calculate a First Nation individual's total exempt working income (line 4) and net exempt income (line 17) for purposes of the Canada workers benefit. Line 7 of Form T90 E(20) refers to the federal, provincial, or territorial government <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID</abbr>-19 payments received in the year.</p>
<p>The instruction for what amounts to be entered on line 7 of Form T90 E(20) further clarifies that only the exempt portion of the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID</abbr>-19 payments received from the federal, provincial, or territorial government be entered on line 7.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr> is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act and therefore, should not be included on line 7 of Form T90.</p>
